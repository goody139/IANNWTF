# Disentanglement in Variational Autoencoder
This paper presents the results of a reimplementation of scientific papers proposing methods to achieve a disentangled representation of data. Specifically, we implemented the Beta Variational Autoencoder, the Spatial Broadcast Decoder and the Hyperprior Variational Autoencoder. Focus of our result is especially laid on the disentanglement of the dataset images. The implementation could partially achieve the results presented by the papers. However, the models did not achieve an overall disentanglement, changes in several parameters of the latent dimension still influenced more than one generative factor in the reconstructed data.
